Castle Battles project
-----------------------

FOLDERS:
  - Battles: Core source code
  - Docs: Latex sources for paper and usage report
  - src: Code and examples to run simulations
  - Examples: Some examples based on the paper results.
  
  
  
How to execute the simulations?
--------------------------------

First of all, read the usage document. Then, read the execute.py file, where some execution lines are commented with different examples.




Examples
--------

In src folder you can watch the base documents to run these examples. The examples are just for try the program features. 
Each example has two files: "example".py and a settings file, that is by default "Battles/Utils/settings.py".

The Examples folder contain examples to run the simulations used in the paper. Note that for some examples there is also its settings file (again, check the usage document to know more about it).
In addition, there are screenshots for some of these examples and text files that contain the execution logs.

The Girona example is a special case, with many examples. The RealData folder contains information on how the intial data has been calculated. 
In the Girona folder there are the main configuration files used for the simulations.
In the results folder there are the results used for the paper. Note that some of them use the configuration files with some changes.

Finally, remember that this simulation program is based in random processes, so your simulation results will not exactly the same than the original ones.



Final notes
-------------

This project has a lot of features, some of them deprecated, commented or unfinished (due project conditions).
Be aware!
