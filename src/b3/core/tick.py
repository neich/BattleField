class Tick(object):
    '''Tick Class.

    A new Tick object is instantiated every tick by BehaviorTree. It is passed
    as parameter to the nodes through the tree during the traversal.

    The role of the Tick class is to store the instances of tree, debug, target
    and blackboard. So, all nodes can access these informations.

    For internal uses, the Tick also is useful to store the open node after the
    tick signal, in order to let `BehaviorTree` to keep track and close them 
    when necessary.

    This class also makes a bridge between nodes and the debug, passing the 
    node state to the debug if the last is provided.
